## üì¶ What's the inside that box?
While you definitely don't need to have a rack in your garage, basement, or even bedroom (Some people do this, I am not usre why), it feels great to have piece of professional computing equipment that is all tidy up and looks straight out of a data center. So let's run down the hardware from top to bottom! I

## üñ•Ô∏è The hardware

It's all keep insdie of an APC 42U cabinet that I acquired from a company that no longer needed it. 

### Networking 

#### [Ubiquiti UDM-SE](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/all-cloud-gateways/products/udm-se)

This is my router and firewall. It is responisble for protecting my network from the internet as well as my inter-vlan routing. It is a Cloud key as well so it can control all my other Unifi devices. Unifi Network version 9 is an amazing upgrade from version 8 and allows me to see all my networking devices in one place. It also provides insights into networking connectivtiy and performance issues. 

##### üîß Hardware
- **Port Layout:**
    * 8x 1 GbE RJ45 (1G/100M/10M)
    * 1x 2.5 GbE RJ45 (2.5G/1G/100M/10M)
    * 2x 10G SFP+ (10G/1G)
- **IDS/IPS Throughput:** 3.5 Gbps

#### [Ubiquiti USW-Pro-Aggregation](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/all-switching/products/usw-pro-aggregation)

This is my core switch or spine. I don't technically have a spine and leaf topology, but hey it's a homelab ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It's rock solid switch and holds all my SFP+ 10G connections. Also, it's nice to have those 25G for Hyperconverged applications or faster backups. 

##### üîß Hardware
- **Port Layout:**
    * 4x 25G SFP28
    * 28x 10G SFP+
- **Switching Capacity:** 760 Gbps
- **Total Non-Blocking Throughput:** 380 Gbps
- **Forwarding Rate:** 565 Mpps

#### [Ubiquiti USW-Pro-24](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/all-switching/products/usw-pro-24)

This is my leaf for all my base-t connections. If it is a management interface or out-of-band IPMI, it's connected here. It's not impressive, but it does it's job perfectly.

##### üîß Hardware
- **Port Layout:**
    * 24x 1 GbE RJ45 (1G/100M/10M)
    * 2x 10G SFP+
- **Switching Capacity:** 88 Gbps
- **Total Non-Blocking Throughput:** 44 Gbps
- **Forwarding Rate:** 65 Mpps

### Compute

#### [TerraMaster‚ÄØF4‚Äë424‚ÄØMax](https://www.terra-master.com/us/f4-424-max.html)

This is my second backup server. I use ZFS replication to backup my most important files from my primary storage. I love this machine. It's compact, quiet, and has an impressive CPU. I am defintely not using it to it's max in any way. My only complaint is that TOS is not great. It's getting better and better, but it can't compete with TrueNAS or Unraid. Mine has 2x NVMe for TrueNAS OS and 4x 16TB HDDs.

##### üîß Hardware
 - **CPU:** Intel Core i5‚Äë1235U (10 cores/12 threads, up to 4.4‚ÄØGHz) with integrated Iris‚ÄØXe graphics
- **Memory:** 32GB of DDR5 5600MT/s 
- **Storage Bays:**
    * 4x 16TB HDDs
    * 2x 512GB NVMe
- **Networking:** Dual 10GbE RJ‚Äë45 ports
- **USB Ports:** Two USB‚ÄëA and one USB‚ÄëC (Gen‚ÄØ2, 10‚ÄØGbps) on the rear for external drives or accessories 

##### üëé Downsides
- There are only 4 bays!

#### Dell PowerEdge R440

This my bare metal docker host. It runs Ubuntu 24.04! I like to keep in simple and clean since it's main purpose is to be a docker host and nothing else. 

##### üîß Hardware

- **Chassis:** 1U, dual-socket rack server
- **CPU:** Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6138
- **Memory:** 256GB of ECC DDR4
- **Storage:** 4√ó2.5‚Ä≥ 400GB SAS SSDs
- **Networking:**
    - 2√ó 1‚ÄØGbE RJ-45
    - 2x SFP28 via ConnectX4
    - OOB IPMI

##### üëé Downsides
- It's only 1U so there is not a lot of room for PCIe expansion. 
- It can be loud, however once you tune the fan curves it is pretty quiet for 1U server.

#### Supermicro SuperServer 6028TR-DTR 2-Node Server

These are my test servers that I run a variety of software on bare metal before I roll into production. Currently, they are being used as OSNexus hosts for trying out their community edition.

##### üîß Hardware

- **Chassis:** 2U, dual-socket dual-node rack server
- **CPU:** Dual Intel Xeon E5-2680V4
- **Memory:** 128GB of ECC DDR4
- **Storage:** 6√ó2.5‚Ä≥ 400GB SAS SSDs
- **Networking:**
    - 2√ó 1‚ÄØGbE RJ-45
    - 2x 10G SFP+ 
    - OOB IPMI

##### üëé Downsides
- It has a SATA backplane instead of a SAS one. This normally isn't a big deal unless you want to run HA storage software. 
- Only has 8x electrical PCIe slots, 16x physical, but only 8x electrical. 

#### Supermicro SuperServer 6028U-TR4T+ 12 Bay LFF

This is my primary Proxmox host where I run all my workloads.

##### üîß Hardware

- **Chassis:** 2U, dual-socket rack server
- **CPU:** Dual Intel Xeon E5-2680V4
- **Memory:** 512GB of ECC DDR4
- **Storage:** 12√ó 2.5‚Ä≥ 400GB SAS SSDs
- **Networking:**
    - 4√ó 10‚ÄØGbE RJ-45
    - 2x 25G SFP28 
    - OOB IPMI

##### üëé Downsides
- The E5-2680V4 are rock-solid, but are a little long in the tooth nowadays. I am looking to upgrade to Xeon Scalable Gen 1 or 2 in the near future

#### Supermicro CSE-847BE1C-R1K28LPB 4U 36-Bay

This is my primary sotrage server running TrueNAS communtiy edition. It's got almost 192TB of SAS Flash and it rips through anything I throw at it. 

##### üîß Hardware

- **Chassis:** 4U, single socket rack server
- **CPU:** Epyc 7302P - 16 cores/32 Threads
- **Memory:** 256GB of ECC DDR4
- **Storage:** 36√ó 2.5‚Ä≥ 7.68TB SAS SSDs
- **Networking:**
    - 2√ó 1‚ÄØGbE RJ-45
    - 2x 25G SFP28
    - OOB IPMI

##### üëé Downsides
- It's a chonker. It's heavy even if there are no drives in it. 

## Power

### Eaton Tripp Lite Series 2200VA Smart UPS

Agurably the most important power of your Homelab, Power! This 2200VA gives me around 1950W of power which is great considering my ciruit only supports up to 2400W theoritically and 1980W practically (80% rule).
