## Digital Infrastructure Engineer | Nature Euthanist & Hike | Data Center & Homelab Expert | Crafting High Availability & Resilient Systems 

## ðŸ¤¨ Who am I? 

I'm a dedicated technology enthusiast and digital infrastructure engineer. With a passion for open-source solutions, containerization, and virtualization. I have worked from the helpdesk to the being a full time Digitial Infrastructure Engineer. Also, I help support my friend Rich Teslow's Youtube channel [2GT](https://www.youtube.com/@2GuysTek). At 2GT, I am a host on the podcast as well as running the live show and the infrastructure. When I am done working, I like to hangout on Discord and play collbrative vidoes games as well go on hikes to state and national parks with my partner and dog, Finnley!
