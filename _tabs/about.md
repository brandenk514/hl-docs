## ðŸ¤¨ Who am I? 

I'm a dedicated technology enthusiast and digital infrastructure engineer. With a passion for open-source solutions, containerization, and virtualization. I have worked from the helpdesk to the being a full time Digitial Infrastructure Engineer. Also, I help support my friend Rich Teslow's Youtube channel [2GT](https://www.youtube.com/@2GuysTek). At 2GT, I am a host on the podcast as well as running the live show and the infrastructure. When I am done working, I like to hangout on Discord and play collbrative vidoes games as well go on hikes to state and national parks with my partner and dog, Finnley!

## Why create this? 
I wanted a place to store my own documentation and share with you and everyone else. I find that not all documentation is thorough enough and misses some critical explaination with screenshots, etc. It also helps me restore my HomeLab in the event it should come to ruin.
